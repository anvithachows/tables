No, a final class cannot be inherited.

In Java, when you declare a class as final, it means:

No other class can extend it.

It cannot be subclassed.

It is used to prevent modification of its behavior.

final class A {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Inside A");
    }
}

class B extends A {  
}
