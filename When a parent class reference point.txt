When a parent class reference points to a child class object, it is known as upcasting in Java.

You can only access parent class methods/variables

Even though the object is of the child class, the reference type decides what you can access.

Parent p = new Child();

Overridden methods run from the child class

This is runtime polymorphism.

Even if the reference is of the parent type, Java executes the child class override version of the method.

Child-specific methods are NOT accessible
