No, you cannot inherit a private method.

A private method in a class is accessible only within the same class.
Even if another class extends it (i.e., inherits from it), the child class cannot see or use the private method because:

Private methods are not part of the subclass’s accessible members

They are hidden from child classes.

At compile time, the subclass cannot call the parent’s private method.
