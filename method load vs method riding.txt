Method overloading happens within the same class or sometimes in a child class.

It does not depend on inheritance.

You create multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (type, number, or order).

Same method name.

Different parameter list.

Return type can be same or different.

Decided at compile time.


Method overriding only happens when a child class inherits a method from the parent.

The child class redefines the parent class method with the same name, same parameters, same return type.

Same method name.

Same parameters.

Same return type.

Happens between parent–child classes.

Decided at runtime (dynamic dispatch).

Achieves runtime polymorphism.
